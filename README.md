## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Output from the linear regression
#### As shown in the following image from the summary output,

### 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
#### 

### 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
#### 

### 3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
#### 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### There is a summary that addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and each lot individually (5 pt)
### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

### What metric or metrics are you going to test?
#### To run an accurate analysis, the metrics to test would be: fuel efficiency, one-change energy eficiency, one-charge energy capacity, vechicle cost, electricity cost, fuel cost, distance traveled in city, distance traveled in high way, manufacturer, maintenance cost, maintenance frequency. 

### .1 What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
#### Null hypothesis: Electric vehicles and fuel vehicles are equally costly to drive and maintain.

### 2. What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
#### A "" test is needed to validate or reject the null hypothesis.

### 3. What data is needed to run the statistical test?
#### The required data to run a statisticall test would be: fuel efficiency in
